Algorithm Challenge #34 – Return Number Index in Array
-
🔍 Problem Description
-
This program fills an array with random numbers between 1 and 100.
Then it asks the user for a number and searches for it inside the array.

If found → returns the index (0-based) and its order (1-based).

If not found → returns -1.

This challenge reinforces linear search and array traversal.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
Generating random values using rand()

Filling and printing arrays

Searching arrays using linear search

Returning index/order values

Clean, modular C++ function design

🧩 Example Execution
-
Input:

Enter number of elements: 10

Enter number to search for: 55

Output (example):

Array Elements:

12 55 90 11 42 67 73 19 5 88

Number you are looking for: 55

The number was found at index (0-based): 1

The number was found at order (1-based): 2


📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: find_number_index.cpp

Challenge Number: #34

💬 Notes
-
Linear search is the simplest and most intuitive method for searching arrays.
Understanding this concept builds the foundation for advanced searching algorithms such as binary search.
